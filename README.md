### NOTICE!
the following part adapted from [ForceBindIP](https://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip)

#### Google Chrome Compatibility
Chrome requires additional configuration to run under ForceBindIP. This is because Chrome 72 or later blocks 3rd party programs from injecting DLLs. To allow ForceBindIP to work, install this [enterprise policy registry file](https://r1ch.net/assets/forcebindip/Chrome72.reg) to re-enable DLL injection, then open Chrome and go to
```
chrome://flags/#network-service-in-process
```
and enable the setting (Chrome 76+) or
```
chrome://flags#network-service
```
and disable the setting (Chrome 75-).

##### Firefox Compatibility
Firefox requires the
```
about:config?filter=browser.launcherProcess.enabled
```
preference set to false, otherwise ForceBindIP attaches to the launcher and not the actual program.
